#MeanStack app based on Angular 10, Node v-14.7, Express, Mongoose and MongoDB

#the application has an arquitechture based on parent (app-module) and child modules.

#each one of these modules have their own routing, components, services and modules, respectig the separation of concerns

#It has heavy use of Rxjs Librarty: Observables, Subjects, Behavioral Subjects, Event Emittes, etc

#"Uses also Atribute and Structural Directives, a local Service, Inout and Output bindings for reusable components

#Concerning the backend the strucutre is as it follows: the file server.js where the server is configured. The file app.js whre we have the database connection and the routes. Each route has his seperated login (and models), respecting the front end requirements. This meanstack app was developed both front and back end at the same time

 #ested routing is another feature, as the app has a shell components for bootstrap, therefore all modules are childmodules
 
 #Bugs an todos:
 
 Mobile CSS and features
 some repeated functions in several services. A generic data Service is in need
